# Something-New
Learning a new thing is not always fun

The need for continuous self-improvement is critical

I know what I know because of learning.
I am what I know, thus, I am what I study.

Wisdom is gain through lessons garned from life experiences and self-improvements.
Wisdom - Knowledge - Understanding
